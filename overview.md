title: 8-Bit Computer Overview

I have long desired to build a CPU from scratch, at least as early as my course in Computer Architecture at university, but it's always been a project for _one day_.  A few years back I discovered the amazing work of [Ben Eater](https://eater.net), and picked up two of his kits. One of the kits I purchased was [_Build an 8-bit computer from scratch_](https://eater.net/8bit). It's been sitting in my cupboard for many years now just waiting for the chance to be built. Finally it's having the dust blown off and my son (9 years) and I are going to build it together.

As many who know me, I am obsessive about documentation, not only is it useful to know what you did, but the process of writing things down improves comprehension - so in these pages you will find my notes and progress of the build. Of course for the most part they are built on the videos and documenation from Ben, but transformed and enhanced by my experience, where I fell down a rabit hole to learn more on certain topics, trouble shooting issues or just explaining the concept to my son. 

I doubt many others will read this, and this will just be for my own documentation purposes but in case you stumble on this, I hope it proves useful!

Lastly I will say _thanks_ to Ben for creating this project in the first place; it's an amazing piece of educational work for engineers of all ages and experience, and I am looking forward to sharing this with my son :)

You should absolutely make sure you support his work; subscribe to his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater), view the videos on his channel, and purchase a kit from him.
